# Minesweeper
 
This is merely a project I have decided to make. It's really just a game of minesweeper I made.

> **[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** if you don't have it yet. It's necessary.

# Contents

This game will include:
- Multiple modes
- Pygame interface
- Customisable boards
- Many more

In order to install the requirements for this game, using cmd terminal, run:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
This will install the most up to date version of pygame for your version of python.

To launch the game, open up a command window in the file explorer location and run:

```bash
python main.py
```
or just launch the file entitled **main.py** in the main repository. After this, you should have a game of minesweeper up on your screen!
